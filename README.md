# FE Netflix Clone

## Overview
I wanted to get some practice with API consumption and challenge myself with some new concepts so I followed along with Clever Programmer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtMThy8QKqU&ab_channel=CleverProgrammer) and we build this Netflix Clone.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, axios, Firebase

## Reflection
- I quite liked the ease of use for Firebase; the CLI is so simple and well done. 
- I liked the way that CP extrapolated his components and the way he did his file tree. It was slightly different from my stlye; his was clear for understanding.
- I am probably most captvated by the conditional formatting that leverages optional chaining (which I've learned is a clean and lean way to handle load errors).
- Even though I've used dependency arrays before, his explanation of their use made it really solidify for me

## Plans
- Could I make an annoying autoplay on :hover over one of the movie poster?
- I think it would be a great challenge in a few weeks from this (I'm workign through a Ruby on Rails course) to connect this to a backend with user and authentication and in that way, make it closer to the real Netflix.
